This e2e test, tests the functionality of
the game when the player tries to walk out 
of bounds. This means that player tries to 
move outside the grid.

In this case, it should act like a wall.
The player should not be allowed to move,
with an appropriate message telling that
they tried to walk into a wall.

This move should not be added in the list,
and number of moves made by the player.
